# 📊 Predicting Customer Churn Using Machine Learning

[GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Priyadharshini-R123/phase_3.git)

## 📌 Project Overview

Customer churn represents a major concern for businesses, especially in the telecom sector. This project applies machine learning to predict whether a customer is likely to churn based on their demographic and behavioral data. With the help of models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost, the system uncovers hidden patterns in customer behavior, enabling proactive retention strategies.

---

## 🧠 Problem Statement

Customer churn is the process when customers stop doing business with a company. In a competitive market, identifying customers at risk of churning is vital. This project uses machine learning models to predict churn based on customer data, aiding in improving retention and reducing revenue loss.

---

## 🧾 Abstract

The dataset includes customer demographics, contract details, billing data, and service usage patterns. After thorough data preprocessing, multiple classification models were trained:

- ✅ Logistic Regression
- ✅ Random Forest
- ✅ XGBoost (Best Model)

**Best Performance**:  
- **Accuracy**: 86%  
- **F1 Score**: 0.82  
- **AUC**: 0.88

Interpretability was achieved through SHAP value analysis, highlighting the most influential features like contract type, tenure, and monthly charges.

## 🧬 Dataset Description

* **Source**: Kaggle / IBM Telco Customer Churn Dataset
* **Size**: \~7000 records
* **Features**: Customer demographics, contract type, services used, charges, etc.
* **Target Variable**: `Churn (Yes/No)`

---

## 🛠️ Data Preprocessing

* Handled missing values via imputation
* Removed duplicates
* Outlier handling using IQR
* Label & One-Hot Encoding for categoricals
* MinMax scaling for numeric features

---

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

* High churn observed among:

  * Short contract customers
  * High billing customers
  * Fiber internet users
* Used: Histograms, Boxplots, Heatmaps

---

## 🔍 Feature Engineering

* Created new features like `TotalServicesUsed` and `EngagementScore`
* Generated interaction terms
* Feature selection using `SelectKBest`
* Applied PCA for dimensionality reduction

---

## 🤖 Model Building

* Models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost
* Data split: 80-20 (Train-Test)
* **Best Model**: XGBoost

  * Accuracy: **86%**
  * F1-Score: **0.82**
  * AUC: **0.88**

---

## 🧪 Model Evaluation

* Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, F1-score, AUC
* Confusion Matrix: Shows strong precision/recall for XGBoost
* SHAP Values: Key influencers—Contract Type, Tenure, Monthly Charges

---

## 🚀 Deployment Plan

* Model compatible with Flask/Streamlit (UI integration pending)
* SHAP visualizations included for transparency

## 🧾 Sample Code Snippet

```python
# Load and preprocess data
df = pd.read_csv("customer_churn.csv")
df['TotalServicesUsed'] = df['PhoneService'] + df['InternetService']
df['EngagementScore'] = df['Contract'] * df['tenure']

# Train/Test Split
X = df.drop(['customerID', 'Churn'], axis=1)
y = df['Churn']
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, stratify=y, random_state=42)

# Train Model
model = XGBClassifier()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Evaluate
print(classification_report(y_test, model.predict(X_test)))
```
